This code aims to practice with the Julia's programming language. In particular with the 
Pkg Manager and Templates. 

The Continuous Integration offered by GitLab could be a useful tool to ensure and preserve the code. As every good Julians knows a porject isn't developed by him-self, but thanks other contributors.
